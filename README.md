<center><h1>P-median problem</h1></center>

The p-median problem is useful to model many real world situations such as the location of public or industrial facilities, warehouses and others. The p-median problem differs from the UFLP in two respects â€” there are no costs for opening facilities and there is an upper bound on the number of facilities that should be opened. It models the problem of finding a minimum cost clustering and belongs to the class of  NP hard problems in strong sense.
